# Orginal Task 

## Project 12
An Operating System (OS) is a collection of software services, designed to close gaps between the
computer's hardware and software hierarchy.

For example, if you use a high-level language to write
a program that prompts the user to enter some data using the keyboard, and you then plot this
data on the screen, the code generated by the compiler will include (among other things) calls to
OS routines that handle keyboard inputs and graphics outputs. 

In this last project in the Nand to
Tetris journey we will implement such an OS. The Jack OS consists of eight .Jack class files, each
realizing a library of commonly used OS services such as input / output drivers, math operations,
string processing, and memory management

## Objective
Implement the operating system described in lecture / chapter 12.
