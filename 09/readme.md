# Orginal Task 

## Project 9

In this project you will write a program in Jack: A simple, Java-like, object-based programming
language. This will set the stage for subsequent stages in our journey, in which we will build a Jack
compiler, and a basic operating system.

## Objective

The "hidden agenda" of this project is to get acquainted with the Jack language, for two
subsequent landmarks: writing a Jack compiler in projects 10 and 11, and developing a basic
operating system in project 12 (the OS will be written in Jack, just like modern OSs are written in
high-level languages like C++). 

In addition, you’ll become familiar with the art of writing a program
that combines graphics, animation, and user interaction – a useful skill in and of itself.
