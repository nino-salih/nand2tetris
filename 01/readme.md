# Orginal Task 

## Project 1
A typical computer architecture is based on a set of elementary logic gates like And, Or, Mux, etc.,
as well as their bitwise versions And16, Or16, Mux16, etc. (assuming a 16-bit machine). In this
project you will build a typical set of basic logic gates. These gates form the elementary building
blocks from which you will build the computerâ€™s CPU and RAM chips in later projects.
Below we describe the tools, resources, and implementation tips needed for completing project 1.

## Objective
Build the following logic gates:
 - Nand (given)
 - Not
 - And
 - Or
 - Xor
 - Mux
 - DMux
 - Not16
 - And16
 - Or16
 - Mux16
 - Or8Way
 - Mux4Way16
 - Mux8Way16
 - DMux4Way
 - DMux8Way

The only building blocks that you can use are primitive Nand gates and the composite gates that
you will gradually build on top of them. Since Nand is considered primitive, there is no need to
implement it.
