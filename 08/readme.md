# Additional information

The finished VM Translator is in the folder [VMTranslator](./VMTranslator).

It's written in Java and uses Gradle as the build tool.

If you're not familiar with Gradle, you can run `./gradlew build` to get a `jar`.

# Orginal Task 

## Project 8

In project 7 you built a basic VM translator that implements the VM language’s arithmetic-logical
and push/pop commands. In this project you will extend this translator to handle the VM
language’s branching and function commands. In addition, you will add the capability of translating
multi-file VM programs. This will complete the development of the VM translator that will later
serve as the compiler’s backend.

## Objective

Extend the basic VM translator built in project 7 into a full-scale VM translator, designed to handle
multi-file programs written in the VM language. This version of the VM translator assumes that the
source VM code is error-free. Error checking, reporting and handling can be added to later versions
of the VM translator, but are not part of this project.
