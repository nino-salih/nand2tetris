# Orginal Task 

## Project 11
The compiler built in Nand to Tetris consists of two main modules: Syntax Analyzer, built in project
10, and Code Generator, built in this project. The former module is the point of departure for the
latter module. In particular, in this project you will morph the Syntax Analyzer built in project 10
into a full-scale Jack compiler, by gradually replacing the routines that generate passive XML output
with routines that generate executable VM code.

## Objective
Extend the Syntax Analyzer built in chapter 10 into a full-scale Jack compiler. Apply your evolving
compiler to all the test programs described below. Execute each translated program, and make
sure that it operates according to its given documentation. This version of the compiler assumes
that the source Jack code is error-free.
