# Nand2Tetris

This repository contains my solutions to the projects in the Nand2Tetris course. The course is designed to teach computer science students how to build a modern computer system from the ground up, starting with the basic building blocks of logic gates and working up to a fully functional operating system. 

**Only projects 1 to 10 are implemented**.

**The assembler, compiler etc are written in `Java`**.

## Course Overview

The course is divided into two parts:

1. Building a computer from the ground up, starting with the basic building blocks of logic gates and working all the way up to a fully functional computer system.
2. Writing software for the computer, including an assembler, a virtual machine, a compiler, and an operating system.

## Folder Descriptions

The course is divided into 12 folders, each containing the projects for a different part of the course. Here's a brief description of each folder:

1. [`01`](./01): Boolean Logic - Building basic logic gates and combinational circuits.
2. [`02`](./02): Boolean Arithmetic - Building an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).
3. [`03`](./03): Sequential Logic - building bits, registers and memory.
4. [`04`](./04): Machine Language - Writing low-level machine language programs to run on the computer.
5. [`05`](./05): Computer Architecture - building the finished computer, including a CPU, memory.
6. [`06`](./06): Assembler - Develop an assembler to translate programs written in Hack assembly language into machine language.
7. [`07`](./07): VM I: Stack Arithmetic - Development of a VM to assembler translator, implementing arithmetic-logical and push/pop instructions.
8. [`08`](./08): VM II: Program Control - Finishing the VM to assembler translator with branching and function commands.
9. [`09`](./09): High-Level Language - Writing a program in Jack
10. [`10`](./10): Compiler I: Syntax Analysis - Develop a compiler for Jack, focusing only on syntax analysis.
11. [`11`](./11): Compiler II: Code Generation - Extend the syntax analyser into a full Jack compiler.
12. [`12`](./12): Operating System - Implementation of the Jack OS
