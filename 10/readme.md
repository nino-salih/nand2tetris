# Additional information

The parser is in the folder [Compiler](./Compiler).

It's written in Java and uses Gradle as the build tool.

If you're not familiar with Gradle, you can run `./gradlew build` to get a `jar`.

# Orginal Task 

## Project 10
In projects 10 and 11 you’ll develop a compiler for Jack, a simple, Java-like, object-based, high-level
language. You will write this compiler in two main stages. In this project you’ll develop a
compilation engine that performs syntax analysis (also called parsing). In project 11 you’ll extend
the compilation engine to a full-scale compiler that generates executable VM code.

## Objective
Build a syntax analyzer that parses Jack programs according to the Jack grammar. To enable testing
for correctness, the analyzer will output XML code, reflecting the syntactic structure of the input
source code. This version of the syntax analyzer assumes that the source Jack code is error-free.
Error checking, reporting and handling can be added to later versions of the analyzer, but are not
part of this project.
